    // NOTE: Before you're tempted to alias map/flatMap, consider that they
    // are probably the best names at the moment.
    // - map() is good because it maps an optional to something non-nil
    //   (i.e. the closure must return a non-nil value).
    // - flatMap() is not so good. It's still a mapping operation. However,
    //   it can return nil (i.e. in case the mapping is not possible).
    //   The prefix "flat" does not signify this, but I couldn't find
    //   a suitable alternative. So, since map/flatMap are well known terms
    //   of art, perhaps it's better to keep them as-is.
    //   (I tried "wrap" or "unwrap" but neither convey "mapping".)
